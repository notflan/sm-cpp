Example of a contextual state machine implementation in C(++)

Goal:
	A PoC full C implementation of 'generator' functions in C using the rather janky `_Generic`.
	Currently the implementation is in an extremely small subset of C++ using only a few templates to get around C's janky implementation of generics.
